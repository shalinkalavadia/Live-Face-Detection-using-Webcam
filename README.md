# Live-Face-Detection-using-Webcam

-This project was done with this fantastic “Open Source Computer Vision Library”, the OpenCV.
-OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. So, it’s perfect for real-time face recognition using a camera.

To create a complete project on Face Recognition, I have worked on 3 very distinct phases:
1)Face Detection and Data Gathering
2)Train the Recognizer
3)Face Recognition
